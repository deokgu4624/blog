        <div class="plot1">WALL•E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) is the last robot left on Earth, programmed to clean up the planet, one trash cube at a time. However, after 700 years, he’s developed one little glitch—a personality. He’s extremely curious, highly inquisitive, and a little lonely.</div>

        <div class="plot2">EVE (Extra-Terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) is a sleek, state-of-the-art probe-droid. She’s fast, she flies, and she’s equipped with a laser gun. EVE, also called Probe One by the captain of the Axiom (the enormous luxury mother ship which houses thousands of displaced humans), is one of a fleet of similar robots sent to Earth on an undisclosed scanning mission.</div>

        <div class="plot4">Auto is the Axiom’s autopilot, who has piloted the ship through all of its 700 years in space. A carefully programmed robot in the form of the ship’s steering wheel, Auto’s manner is cold, mechanical, and seemingly dutiful to the captain.</div>
